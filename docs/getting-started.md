# Getting Started

## Try Slang

Try Slang locally in your browser without downloading or installing anything with [Slang-Playground](/slang-playground).

## Download Prebuilt Release

[Download latest release here.](https://github.com/shader-slang/slang/releases/latest)

Binary packages are currently available for:

* Windows 64-bit x86-64, arm64
* Ubuntu Linux 64-bit x86-64, arm64
* MacOS x86-64, Apple Silicon

Binary releases include the command-line compiler `slangc`, a shared library for the compiler, and the header files necessary for interacting with that library.

Slang is also distributed with the [Vulkan SDK](https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/).

## Build from Source

Instructions for building Slang from source code are maintained as part of the source code repository, [here](https://github.com/shader-slang/slang/blob/master/docs/building.md).

## Your First Slang Shader

Follow [this tutorial](/docs/first-slang-shader) on how to write your first Slang shader and compile it for execution with the Vulkan API.

## The User-Guide

Check out the [Slang User's Guide](https://shader-slang.com/slang/user-guide/index.html) to learn more about the language features, and [Slang Standard Library Reference](https://shader-slang.com/stdlib-reference) for detailed documentation on Slang's builtin types and functions available for use in your shader code.
